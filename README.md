# Stock-Analysis
##Overview of the Project
 Steve wants to further view and analyze his entire stocks investments.
##Purpose
 To help view Steve view and analyze all of his stock investments in as less time as possible using refractoring coding process.
##Summary
 ###Advantages
    Refractoring is very helpful especially when it comes to modifiying an existing code and making it more efficient for the end user, no matter whi has written the initial code.
 ###Disadvantages
    Although refactoring is helpful in most cases but sometimes, according to my past experience, it can take alot more time to understand, evaluate and make changes to a code      written by someone else.
